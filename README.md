## W1- Setting Up and Web Art

During this project, I faced several challenges setting up my development environment. I struggled with initializing the Git repository, configuring SSH keys, and switching from HTTPS to SSH to avoid constant password prompts. Through trial and error, I learned how to properly configure ssh-agent, add my SSH key to GitHub, and resolve merge conflicts.

## W2- Swiss poster

I did the poster design and it was actually a bit confusing since I had 0 expereince. But I got something. However, unfortunately, I pushed it to the main branch and did not use a separate repository. I led some confusion and I wonder how to get it back. 
Also, I awalys need to enter password after I push a new branch to main. I wonder why that happened.
