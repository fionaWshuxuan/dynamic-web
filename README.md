## W1- Setting Up and Web Art

During this project, I faced several challenges setting up my development environment. I struggled with initializing the Git repository, configuring SSH keys, and switching from HTTPS to SSH to avoid constant password prompts. Through trial and error, I learned how to properly configure ssh-agent, add my SSH key to GitHub, and resolve merge conflicts.
